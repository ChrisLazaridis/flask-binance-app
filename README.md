# flask-binance-app
as of this point I have a added a trade analyzer for crypto pairs, an equity shower (locked and free) and a news tab using the newsapi
I can't proceed to making it an AI trader companion for crypto since the costs are too high so for now, this is just a proof of concept, if at some point there is a way to use a free llm then I can continue working on 
the project but for now this is all it is
also in no way I consider this safe so if you for some reason want to run it, do it at your own risk, if for any reason it happens to mess with your binance account I am not to blame
